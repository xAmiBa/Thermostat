# Thermostat Control Web App

This is a simple web application that simulates the control of a thermostat. You can interact with the thermostat to adjust its temperature and power-saving mode.

## What I Learned

In the process of creating this web app, I learned several key concepts and technologies:

### 1. Express.js

I used Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to build the web server. Express allowed me to define routes and handle HTTP requests easily.

### 2. RESTful Routing

I implemented RESTful routing to handle various thermostat actions such as getting the temperature, increasing and decreasing the temperature, changing power-saving mode, and resetting the temperature.

### 3. JSON Data

I used JSON to represent temperature data and communicated with the server using JSON. JSON.stringify and JSON.parse helped with data serialization and deserialization.

### 4. HTTP Methods

I handled different HTTP methods, such as GET for retrieving data and POST for making changes to the thermostat settings.

### 5. Testing with Jest

To ensure the correctness of the thermostat class, I wrote unit tests using the Jest testing framework. This allowed me to verify that the thermostat's functions worked as expected.

### 6. Query Parameters

I utilized query parameters in the routes to pass additional information, such as the choice of turning power-saving mode on or off.
